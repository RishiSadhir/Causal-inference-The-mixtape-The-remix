# Causal inference: The mixtape: The remix

This repisotry presents a a companion to Scott Cunningham's [`Causal Inference: The Mixtape (V. 1.7)`](http://scunning.com/mixtape.html). The intent is to present the concepts and code examples translated to _R_. It should serve as an example of how to marry modern tidyverse syntax with econometric methods.

# Inspiration
This repository was inspired by the [treatment](https://bookdown.org/connect/#/apps/1850/access) [Solomon Kurz](https://twitter.com/solomonkurz?lang=en) gave to Richard McElreath's wonderful book, [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/).
