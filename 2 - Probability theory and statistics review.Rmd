# Basic probability theory

## Introductory definitions

* *Random process*: A process that, when repeated multiple times, can lead to different outcomes. Can be _discrete_ or _continuous_.
* *Sample space*: Set of all possible outcomes a random process can have.
* *Logical independence*: Two events that can not affect one another.
* *Statistical independence*: Two events $A$ and $B$ are statistically independent if $Pr(A|B) = Pr(A)$.
* *Joint probability*: For independent events, calculating joint probabilities is to multiply the maringal probabilities: $Pr(A, B) = Pr(A)Pr(B)$.
